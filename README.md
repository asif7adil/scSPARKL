# scSPARKL
## An Apache Spark based computational work for the downstream analysis of scRNA-seq data.


# Description
scSPARKL is a simple framework for conducting variety of analysis on scRNA-seq data. It works on the Apache Spark environment which can either be standalon or in distributed mode (depending up on the requirements). 


# Prerequisites
Current implementation has been tested on Microsoft Windows Operating System. 
Other Important prerequisites include:
<br>
[Java (latest)] (https://www.java.com/download/ie_manual.jsp)
